Parallel processing in Neuraxle
===================================================================

This demonstrates how to stream data in parallel in a Neuraxle pipeline.
The pipeline steps' parallelism here will be obvious.

The pipeline has two steps:
1. Preprocessing: the step that process the data simply sleeps.
2. Model: the model simply multiplies the data by two. 

This can be used with scikit-learn as well to transform things in parallel,
and any other library such as tensorflow.

Pipelines benchmarked: 
1. We first use a classical pipeline and evaluate the time.
2. Then we use a minibatched pipeline and we evaluate the time.
3. Then we use a parallel pipeline and we evaluate the time.

We expect the parallel pipeline to be faster due to having more workers
in parallel, as well as starting the model's transformations at the same
time that other batches are being preprocessed, using queues.
