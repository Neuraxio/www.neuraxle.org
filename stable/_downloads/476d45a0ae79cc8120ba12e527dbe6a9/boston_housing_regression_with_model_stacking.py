"""
Boston Housing Regression
==========================

This example solves a regression problem using a pipeline with the following steps:

 - Feature augmentation with PCA and Fast ICA,
 - A Pre-regression using an ensemble containing gradient boosted, and a KMeans clustering for even more features in the stacking,
 - The model stacking using a ridge regression.

This example also prints the shapes of the objects between the pipeline elements.
