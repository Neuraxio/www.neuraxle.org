        "\nCreate Pipeline Steps in Neuraxle that doesn't fit or transform\n================================================================\n\nIf a pipeline step doesn't need to be fitted and only transforms data (e.g.: taking the logarithm of the data),\nthen you can inherit from the NonFittableMixin as demonstrated here, which will override the fit method properly\nfor you. You can also use a NonTransformableMixin if your step doesn't transform anything, which is rarer. If your step\nsimply just does nothing to the data, then you could even use the Identity class of Neuraxle, which is simply a class\nthat inherits from both the NonFittableMixin, the NonTransformableMixin, and BaseStep.\n\nMixins are an old Object Oriented Programming (OOP) design pattern that resurfaces when designing\nMachine Learning Pipelines. Those are add-ons to classes to implement some methods in some specific ways already.\nA mixin doesn't inherit from BaseStep itself, because we can combine many of them in one class. However, a mixin must\nsuppose that the object that inherits from the mixin also inherits from it's base class. Here, our base class is the\nBaseStep class.\n\n..\n    Copyright 2019, Neuraxio Inc.\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of tche License at\n\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n\n..\n    Thanks to Umaneo Technologies Inc. for their contributions to this Machine Learning\n    project, visit https://www.umaneo.com/ for more information on Umaneo Technologies Inc.\n"
