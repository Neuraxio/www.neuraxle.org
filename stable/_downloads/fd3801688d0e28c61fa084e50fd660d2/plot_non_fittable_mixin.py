Create Pipeline Steps in Neuraxle that doesn't fit or transform
================================================================

If a pipeline step doesn't need to be fitted and only transforms data (e.g.: taking the logarithm of the data),
then you can inherit from the NonFittableMixin as demonstrated here, which will override the fit method properly
for you. You can also use a NonTransformableMixin if your step doesn't transform anything, which is rarer. If your step
simply just does nothing to the data, then you could even use the Identity class of Neuraxle, which is simply a class
that inherits from both the NonFittableMixin, the NonTransformableMixin, and BaseStep.

Mixins are an old Object Oriented Programming (OOP) design pattern that resurfaces when designing
Machine Learning Pipelines. Those are add-ons to classes to implement some methods in some specific ways already.
A mixin doesn't inherit from BaseStep itself, because we can combine many of them in one class. However, a mixin must
suppose that the object that inherits from the mixin also inherits from it's base class. Here, our base class is the
BaseStep class.
