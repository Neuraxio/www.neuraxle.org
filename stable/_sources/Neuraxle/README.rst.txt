Neuraxle is a Machine Learning (ML) library for building clean machine learning pipelines using the right abstractions.

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated steps, then compose them to build complex pipelines.
- **Evolving State**: Each pipeline step can fit, and evolve through the learning process
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize your pipelines using AutoML, where each pipeline step has their own hyperparameter space.
- **Compatible**: Use your favorite machine learning libraries inside and outside Neuraxle pipelines.
- **Production Ready**: Pipeline steps can manage how they are saved by themselves, and the lifecycle of the objects allow for train, and test modes.
- **Streaming Pipeline**: Transform data in many pipeline steps at the same time in parallel using multiprocessing Queues.

Documentation
-------------

You can find the Neuraxle documentation `on the website <https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/index.html>`_. It also contains multiple examples demonstrating some of its features.


Installation
------------

Simply do:

.. code:: bash

    pip install neuraxle


Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have several `examples on the website <https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/examples/index.html>`__.

For example, you can build a time series processing pipeline as such:

.. code:: python

    p = Pipeline([
        TrainOnlyWrapper(DataShuffler()),
        WindowTimeSeries(),
        
    ])

    # Load data
    X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = generate_classification_data()

    # The pipeline will learn on the data and acquire state.
    p = p.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Once it learned, the pipeline can process new and
    # unseen data for making predictions.
    y_test_predicted = p.predict(X_test)

You can also tune your hyperparameters using AutoML algorithms such as the TPE:

.. code:: python

    # Define classification models with hyperparams.

    # All SKLearn models can be used and compared to each other.
    # Define them an hyperparameter space like this:
    decision_tree_classifier = SKLearnWrapper(
        DecisionTreeClassifier(),
        HyperparameterSpace({
            'criterion': Choice(['gini', 'entropy']),
            'splitter': Choice(['best', 'random']),
            'min_samples_leaf': RandInt(2, 5),
            'min_samples_split': RandInt(2, 4)
        }))

    # More SKLearn models can be added (code details skipped):
    random_forest_classifier = ...
    logistic_regression = ...

    # It's possible to mix TensorFlow models into Neuraxle as well, 
    # using Neuraxle-Tensorflow' Tensorflow2ModelStep class, passing in
    # the TensorFlow functions like create_model and create_optimizer:
    minibatched_tensorflow_classifier = EpochRepeater(MiniBatchSequentialPipeline([
            Tensorflow2ModelStep(
                create_model=create_linear_model,
                create_optimizer=create_adam_optimizer,
                create_loss=create_mse_loss_with_regularization
            ).set_hyperparams_space(HyperparameterSpace({
                'hidden_dim': RandInt(6, 750),
                'layers_stacked_count': RandInt(1, 4),
                'lambda_loss_amount': Uniform(0.0003, 0.001),
                'learning_rate': Uniform(0.001, 0.01),
                'window_size_future': FixedHyperparameter(sequence_length),
                'output_dim': FixedHyperparameter(output_dim),
                'input_dim': FixedHyperparameter(input_dim)
            }))
        ]), epochs=42)

    # Define a classification pipeline that lets the AutoML loop choose one of the classifier.
    # See also ChooseOneStepOf documentation: https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/api/steps/neuraxle.steps.flow.html#neuraxle.steps.flow.ChooseOneStepOf
    pipeline = Pipeline([
        ChooseOneStepOf([
            decision_tree_classifier,
            random_forest_classifier,
            logistic_regression,
            minibatched_tensorflow_classifier,
        ])
    ])

    # Create the AutoML loop object.
    # See also AutoML documentation: https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/api/metaopt/neuraxle.metaopt.auto_ml.html#neuraxle.metaopt.auto_ml.AutoML
    auto_ml = AutoML(
        pipeline=pipeline,
        hyperparams_optimizer=TreeParzenEstimator(
            # This is the TPE as in Hyperopt.
            number_of_initial_random_step=20,
        ),
        validation_splitter=ValidationSplitter(validation_size=0.20),
        scoring_callback=ScoringCallback(accuracy_score, higher_score_is_better=True),
        n_trials=40,
        epochs=1,  # Could be higher if only TF models were used.
        hyperparams_repository=HyperparamsOnDiskRepository(cache_folder=neuraxle_dashboard),
        refit_best_trial=True,
        continue_loop_on_error=False
    )

    # Load data, and launch AutoML loop!
    X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = generate_classification_data()
    auto_ml = auto_ml.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Get the model from the best trial, and make predictions using predict, as per the `refit_best_trial=True` argument to AutoML.
    y_pred = auto_ml.predict(X_test)

    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred)
    print("Test accuracy score:", accuracy)

Why Neuraxle ?
--------------

Most research projects don't ever get to production. However, you want
your project to be production-ready and already adaptable (clean) by the
time you finish it. You also want things to be simple so that you can
get started quickly. Read more about `the why of Neuraxle here. <https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/blob/master/Why%20Neuraxle.rst>`_
