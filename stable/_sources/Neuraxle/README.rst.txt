Neuraxle is a Machine Learning (ML) library for building machine learning pipelines.

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated steps, then compose them to build complex pipelines.
- **Evolving State**: Each pipeline step can fit, and evolve through the learning process
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize your pipelines using AutoML, where each pipeline step has their own hyperparameter space.
- **Compatible**: Use your favorite machine learning libraries inside and outside Neuraxle pipelines.
- **Production Ready**: Pipeline steps can manage how they are saved by themselves, and the lifecycle of the objects allow for train, and test modes.
- **Streaming Pipeline**: Transform data in many pipeline steps at the same time in parallel using multiprocessing Queues.

Documentation
-------------

You can find the Neuraxle documentation `on the website <https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/index.html>`_.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

- `Handler Methods <https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/handler_methods.html>`_
- `Introduction to Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning <https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/hyperparameter_tuning.html>`_
- `Introduction to Random Distributions <https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/random_distributions.html>`_
- `Step Saving And Lifecycle <https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/step_saving_and_lifecycle.html>`_
- `REST API Serving <https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/rest_api_serving.html>`_
- `Complete API documentation <https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/api.html>`_
- `Usage Examples <https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/examples/index.html>`_

Installation
------------

Simply do:

.. code:: bash

    pip install neuraxle


Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have several `examples on the website <https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/examples/index.html>`__.

For example, you can build a time series processing pipeline as such:

.. code:: python

    p = Pipeline([
        TrainOnly(DataShuffler()),
        WindowTimeSeries(),
        MiniBatchSequentialPipeline([
            Tensorflow2ModelStep(
                create_model=create_model,
                create_optimizer=create_optimizer,
                create_loss=create_loss
            ).set_hyperparams(HyperparameterSpace({
                'hidden_dim': 12,
                'layers_stacked_count': 2,
                'lambda_loss_amount': 0.0003,
                'learning_rate': 0.001
                'window_size_future': sequence_length,
                'output_dim': output_dim,
                'input_dim': input_dim
            })).set_hyperparams_space(HyperparameterSpace({
                'hidden_dim': RandInt(6, 750),
                'layers_stacked_count': RandInt(1, 4),
                'lambda_loss_amount': Uniform(0.0003, 0.001),
                'learning_rate': Uniform(0.001, 0.01),
                'window_size_future': FixedHyperparameter(sequence_length),
                'output_dim': FixedHyperparameter(output_dim),
                'input_dim': FixedHyperparameter(input_dim)
            }))
        ])
    ])

    # Load data
    X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = generate_classification_data()

    # The pipeline will learn on the data and acquire state.
    p = p.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Once it learned, the pipeline can process new and
    # unseen data for making predictions.
    y_test_predicted = p.predict(X_test)

You can also tune your hyperparameters using AutoML algorithms such as the TPE:

.. code:: python

    auto_ml = AutoML(
        pipeline=pipeline,
        hyperparams_optimizer=TreeParzenEstimatorHyperparameterSelectionStrategy(
            number_of_initial_random_step=10,
            quantile_threshold=0.3,
            number_good_trials_max_cap=25,
            number_possible_hyperparams_candidates=100,
            prior_weight=0.,
            use_linear_forgetting_weights=False,
            number_recent_trial_at_full_weights=25
        ),
        validation_splitter=ValidationSplitter(test_size=0.20),
        scoring_callback=ScoringCallback(accuracy_score, higher_score_is_better=True),
        callbacks[
            MetricCallback(f1_score, higher_score_is_better=True),
            MetricCallback(precision, higher_score_is_better=True),
            MetricCallback(recall, higher_score_is_better=True)
        ],
        n_trials=7,
        epochs=10,
        hyperparams_repository=HyperparamsJSONRepository(cache_folder='cache'),
        refit_trial=True,
    )

    # Load data, and launch AutoML loop !
    X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = generate_classification_data()
    auto_ml = auto_ml.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Get the model from the best trial, and make predictions using predict.
    best_pipeline = auto_ml.get_best_model()
    y_pred = best_pipeline.predict(X_test)

Why Neuraxle ?
--------------

Most research projects don't ever get to production. However, you want
your project to be production-ready and already adaptable (clean) by the
time you finish it. You also want things to be simple so that you can
get started quickly. Read more about `the why of Neuraxle here. <https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/blob/master/Why%20Neuraxle.rst>`_
