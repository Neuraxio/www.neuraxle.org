<!-- Checklist before merging PR: 

[ ] The above description of the pull request was used to document the new code. 
[ ] Class names and argument / API variables are very clear: there is no possible ambiguity. 
[ ] Argument's dimensions and types are specified for new steps (important). 
[ ] Classes are documented: their behavior is explained beyond just the title of the class. 
[ ] If a numpy array is used, it is important to remember that these arrays are a special type that must be documented accordingly, and that numpy array should not be abused. This is because Neuraxle is a library that is not only limited to transforming numpy arrays. To this effect, numpy steps should probably be located in the existing numpy python files as much as possible. 
[ ] Code coverage is above 90% for the added code.
