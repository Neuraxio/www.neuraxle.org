Create Pipeline Steps that require implementing only handler methods
========================================================================================================================

If a pipeline step only needs to implement handler methods, then you can inherit from the ForceHandleMixin as demonstrated here.
Handler methods are useful when :

    - You need to change the shape of the data container passed to the following steps, or the wrapped steps.
    - You want to apply side effects based on the data container, and the execution context.
    - You want to change the pipeline execution flow based on the data container, and the execution context.
