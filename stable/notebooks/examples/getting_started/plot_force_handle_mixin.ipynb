        "\n# Create Pipeline Steps that require implementing only handler methods\n\nIf a pipeline step only needs to implement handler methods, then you can inherit from the\nForceHandleMixin as demonstrated here. Handler methods are useful when :\n\n    - You need to change the shape of the data container passed to the following steps, or the wrapped steps.\n    - You want to apply side effects based on the data container, and the execution context.\n    - You want to change the pipeline execution flow based on the data container, and the execution context.\n\n..\n    Copyright 2022, Neuraxio Inc.\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n\n..\n    Thanks to Umaneo Technologies Inc. for their contributions to this Machine Learning\n    project, visit https://www.umaneo.com/ for more information on Umaneo Technologies Inc.\n"
